# Calculator Layout 


I figure out:
1) how to have the layout be constrained to the Safe Areas in Portrait and Landscape. 

 2) how to indent the Label with the 0 so that there is 20px distance from the right edge of the screen.

3) how to make the 0 button take up twice as much width as the "." and "=" buttons.
